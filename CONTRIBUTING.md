## Pull Requests

If you've found a bug, please submit a patch as a pull request. Be sure to describe:

1. How can it be reproduced?
2. What did you expect?
3. What actually occurred?
4. Versions, platform, etc.

If your PR solves an issue that affects me, it'll probably get a reply or review. Otherwise, its normal for it to stay open until I get to it. Remember, its open source _software_, not free access to my time, interest, or anything else really.
